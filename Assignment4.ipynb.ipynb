We will use a dataset of light-sheet imaging recorded by the [Ahrens Lab](http://www.janelia.org/lab/ahrens-lab) at Janelia Research Campus. This assignment may cover some new mathematics and biology knowledge, but there is no need to worry as we provide detailed guidance before each space you need to fill. \n","\n","Our dataset is generated by studying the movement of a larval [zebrafish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish), an animal that is especially useful in neuroscience because it is transparent, making it possible to record activity over its entire brain using a technique called [light-sheet microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sheet_fluorescence_microscopy). Specifically, we'll work with time-varying images containing patterns of the zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern. Different stimuli induce different patterns across the brain, and we can use exploratory analyses to identify these patterns. Read [\"Mapping brain activity at scale with cluster computing\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3041) for more information about these kinds of analyses.\n","\n","During this lab you will learn about PCA, and then compare and contrast different exploratory analyses of the same data set to identify which neural patterns they best highlight.\n","\n","## This lab will cover:\n","\n","+  *Part 1:* Work through the steps of PCA on a sample dataset\n"," + *Visualization 1:* Two-dimensional Gaussians\n","\n","+  *Part 2:* Write a PCA function and evaluate PCA on sample datasets\n"," + *Visualization 2:* PCA projection\n"," + *Visualization 3:* Three-dimensional data\n"," + *Visualization 4:* 2D representation of 3D data\n","\n","+  *Part 3:* Parse, inspect, and preprocess neuroscience data then perform PCA\n"," + *Visualization 5:* Pixel intensity\n"," + *Visualization 6:* Normalized data\n"," + *Visualization 7:* Top two components as images\n"," + *Visualization 8:* Top two components as one image\n","\n","+  *Part 4:* Perform feature-based aggregation followed by PCA\n"," + *Visualization 9:* Top two components by time\n"," + *Visualization 10:* Top two components by direction\n","\n","Note that, for reference, you can look up the details of the relevant Spark methods in [Spark's Python API](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html) and the relevant NumPy methods in the [NumPy Reference](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"d7414b3f-a179-493b-814b-993b632b994a","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["## Part 1: Work through the steps of PCA on a sample dataset"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"cellMetadata":{},"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"931faf2f-a7ad-4a08-bf32-201f427ad7e2","showTitle":false,"title":""}},"source":["### Visualization 1: Two-dimensional Gaussians\n","\n","Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a strategy for dimensionality reduction. To better understand PCA, we'll work with synthetic data generated by sampling from the [two-dimensional Gaussian distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution).  This distribution takes as input the mean and variance of each dimension, as well as the covariance between the two dimensions.\n","\n","In our visualizations below, we will specify the mean of each dimension to be 50 and the variance along each dimension to be 1.  We will explore two different values for the covariance: 0 and 0.9. When the covariance is zero, the two dimensions are uncorrelated, and hence the data looks spherical.  In contrast, when the covariance is 0.9, the two dimensions are strongly (positively) correlated and thus the data is non-spherical.
